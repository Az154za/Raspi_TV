# Raspi_TV:
Well this project is about making a tv on my own using a raspberry pi 3B the os in the raspberry pi is Librelec with the free client iptv addon so we can import free channels 
# BOM :

Keep in mind this 3D case is not tested because it's about 250 gram and I'm not experienced in 3D printing because I don't have a printer

Configuration is quite ez it will take you about couple of hours 

I hope you like this project
